        What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the
        experience?
      </h1>
      <p class="padding-style">
        When I first accessed the website, the first thing that caught my
        attention was the style that the creator applied to it. It's a
        combination of collage art and backgrounds that come with grain and
        halftone. Other than that, the way the author chooses colors, typefaces
        are very harmonious and balanced with each other.

        What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?
      </h1>
      <p class="padding-style">
        I think it's scrolling up-down and left-right, because most of the
        interactive elements on the site are associated with the user's
        scrolling motion. Then there are small other components in the
        background with some funny quotes from the author.

        What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the
        experience?

      <p class="padding-style">
        Actually scrolling to explore the whole webpage and then click or hover
        some other clickable items.

        What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive
        experience?
      </h1>
      <p class="padding-style">
        From the experience I could guess the main idea is to create a modern,
        attractive information site with a variety of interactive components to
        make the audience engage with.
      </p>

    <article class="padding-style">
      <h1>
        How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?
      </h1>
      <p class="padding-style">
        Combined from elements such as layout, colors, textures or typefaces,
        all of these things have been put to good use together, nothing
        superfluous. The result was a website that really caught my attention.

        What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with
        over time? (For how long and how many different times)
      </h1>
      <p class="padding-style">
        The webpage is engaging for users both in the long and short time. There
        is a part of the photo of a man who is missing the website and it stands
        out from the surrounding things, making users more curious about how
        this man moves or whether there are any interaction elements attached to
        it. And users can scroll up and down to see his interaction.

        How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be
        interacted with over time?
      </h1>
      <p class="padding-style">
        The whole website is quite easy for users to navigate and master because
        the practical navigation system along with the dynamic layout that the
        author has made extremely good use of. Not only that, the artworks
        included by the author along with their information have made the
        audience more engaged. Some funny elements work effectively as well.

        What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience
        reference?

      <p class="padding-style">
        As from the web page, some other forms included are photography, collage
        art, page layout and some motion graphics.

        What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should act
        when engaging with your research experience?
      </h1>
      <p class="padding-style">
        This research has quite influenced me in the way of compositing, layout
        and how to use interactive components effectively and capture the most
        user engagement. At the same time, it was really useful to show me how
        much content should be displayed, how the site should be navigated, the
        aesthetics of the site, etc. Combined from elements such as layout,
        colors, textures or typefaces, all of these things have been put to good
        use together, nothing superfluous. The result was a website that really
        caught my attention.

        What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should feel
        when engaging with your research experience?
      </h1>
      <p class="padding-style">
        I feel good that the navigation or site flow has fulfilled my desire to
        access it. Along with that, I feel like everything in the site has a
        clear purpose while supplying interactive experiences. It does not cause
        boredom for users, on the contrary, it also makes viewers quite excited
        about the next or below content.

        What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what
        makes that part frustrating?
      </h1>
      <p class="padding-style">
        Overall, everything is good and pretty much in tune with each other.
        However, the only thing that I find annoying is that sometimes when
        scrolling down, it will stop and have to do the scrolling movement
        again.

        What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what
        makes that part satisfying?
      </h1>
      <p class="padding-style">
        What satisfies me the most is the navigation system that the author has
        brought. Great navigation makes all information on the web accessible in
        the right order and complete.
